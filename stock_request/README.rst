Configuration
=============

To configure this module:

-  Go to Stock Requests > Settings

Users should be assigned to the groups 'Stock Request / User' or 'Stock
Request / Manager'.

## Group Stock Request / User

-  Can see her/his own Stock Requests, and others that she/he's been
   granted permission to follow.
-  Can create/update only her/his Stock Requests.

## Group Stock Request / Manager

-  Can fully manage all Stock Requests

Usage
=====

## Creation

-  Go to 'Stock Requests / Stock Requests' and create a new Request.
-  Indicate a product, quantity and location.
-  Press 'Confirm'.

Upon confirmation the request will be evaluated using the procurement
rules for the selected location.

In case that transfers are created, the user will be able to access to
them from the button 'Transfers' available in the Stock Request.

## Cancel

When the user cancels a Stock Request, the related pending stock moves
will be also cancelled.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

There is no way to achieve Storck Request and Stock Request Orders. It
should be developed taking into account that only Cancel and Done stock
request can be archived.

It is also required to manage active field logically from Orders to SRs.
